<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website  under the brand name DryFruto.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core App:** A full-stack web application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- **Branding:** Use the business name DryFruto and slogan Live With Health.
- **Functionality:** Product pages must have WhatsApp and Call buttons instead of a standard checkout.
- **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive admin panel is required to manage all website content, including UI elements, products, and site settings.
- **Feature Enhancements (added during sessions):**
    - Make contact info, social media links, and various page content (About Us, Bulk Order) configurable via the admin panel.
    - Implement local file uploads for images.
    - Allow setting custom prices for each product size variant.
    - Add Bulk Order, Career, and About Us pages.
    - Create a Submissions section in the admin panel to track and export form data.
    - Implement a site-wide CSS theme customizer (later removed and replaced with a hardcoded theme).
    - Add SKU to the product detail page.
    - The user repeatedly requested and then rejected various deployment solutions (manual scripts, Docker).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A functional full-stack application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. All core features from the original problem statement are implemented. The application's content is managed through a comprehensive admin panel. A significant amount of work was done to create a dynamic CSS theme customizer in the admin panel, but this was later removed at the user's request. The entire application's color scheme has been hardcoded to a Light Pastel Green theme, which the user now wants to change again. All previously created deployment scripts and Docker files have been deleted per the user's instructions.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested to change the website's theme color, with  as the new primary color, and to remove the Latest Gift Boxes Collection section from the homepage. The agent was in the process of starting this task and had just inspected the  file.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0): Implement new theme color and remove homepage section.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The task has just begun.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Edit  to remove the component responsible for the Latest Gift Boxes Collection.
        2.  Perform a global search for the old Light Pastel Green color codes (e.g., , ) and replace them with new Tailwind CSS classes that reflect the primary color  and its shades. This will involve editing multiple files, including , , and various page/component files.
        3.  Take a screenshot of the homepage to verify the section is removed and the new color is applied.
        4.  Take screenshots of other key pages (Product, Admin, etc.) to confirm the color change is site-wide.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To fulfill the user's latest UI and branding request.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete the About Us page configurability.**
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent created  and added the necessary fields to the backend model in . However, the implementation was paused when the user requested the theme editor. The  component needs to be fully implemented and integrated into the admin panel to allow saving changes.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The content of the  page will be fully manageable from the admin panel.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Paused)
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on something:** The user's frequent change in priorities. The agent should complete the current color change task and then ask the user if this is the next priority.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   None. The user has not specified any future tasks. The project is currently in an iterative refinement phase based on immediate feedback.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **UI Fix:** Aligned the Submit and WhatsApp buttons on the Bulk Order page.
-   **Feature & Reversal (Theming):**
    -   Built and tested a complete CSS theme customizer in the admin panel. (DONE & REVERTED)
    -   Removed the theme customizer and all related files/routes upon user request. (DONE)
-   **UI Feature:** Added SKU display to the product detail page.
-   **Bug Fix:** Fixed a 422 Unprocessable Entity error that prevented saving changes in the admin panel by correcting a Pydantic model datatype mismatch in .
-   **Deployment Files (Creation & Deletion):**
    -   Created and subsequently deleted comprehensive deployment scripts (manual and Docker) for Hostinger VPS.
-   **Dependency Fix:** Resolved an Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help error by updating  and .
-   **Hardcoded Theming:** Replaced the entire website's color scheme with a hardcoded Light Pastel Green theme.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend Build:** The React app is pre-built into the  directory.
-   **Hardcoded Styling:** The dynamic CSS theme system was removed. All styling is now done via hardcoded TailwindCSS classes in the JSX files. Any color change requires editing numerous files.
-   **State Management:** A global  in React fetches all API data on initial load.

**key DB schema**
-   **site_settings:** A singleton document that was modified to include fields for the About Us page (, , etc.) and temporarily held theme settings (, ) which are now obsolete but may still exist in the backend model.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx**: The file being modified for the current task.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/layout/Header.jsx**: Needs to be edited for color changes.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/layout/Footer.jsx**: Needs to be edited for color changes.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Contains obsolete Pydantic model fields and possibly API endpoints from the removed theme feature that need cleanup.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/AboutUsManager.jsx**: An incomplete component for a paused task.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Obsolete Backend Code:** The  file contains Pydantic model fields (e.g., , ) and an  endpoint related to the removed theme feature. These should be removed to clean up the codebase.
-   **Incomplete Feature:** The  component and its related logic for making the About Us page configurable is incomplete and should either be finished or removed.

**key api endpoints**
-   : (PUT) The primary endpoint used for saving all admin panel configuration.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User changes direction frequently:** The user has a history of requesting complex features (theme editor, deployment scripts) and then asking for them to be completely removed. Always confirm the plan with the user before starting significant work, and be prepared to revert changes.
-   **Theming is now hardcoded:** The application has no dynamic theme editor. All color and style changes must be made by manually editing TailwindCSS classes across the frontend codebase.
-   **Deployment is manual:** The user has explicitly rejected automated deployment solutions. Do not re-introduce Docker or deployment scripts unless the user asks for them again.
-   **Backend cleanup required:** The backend code in  has leftover fields and endpoints from the removed theme feature. This technical debt should be addressed to prevent future bugs.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    was updated during the session but its contents relate to a now-removed feature.
-   All deployment-related documentation was created and subsequently deleted.

-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
-   **Test files created:** None.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   **Backend Cleanup:** The agent did not remove the obsolete Pydantic model fields and API endpoints from  after the user requested the removal of the theme/CSS feature.
-   **Complete Paused Task:** The task to make the About Us page configurable was paused and never completed. The file  is incomplete.</analysis>
