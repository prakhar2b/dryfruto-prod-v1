<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website  under the brand name DryFruto.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core App:** A full-stack web application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- **Branding:** Use the business name DryFruto and slogan Live With Health.
- **Functionality:** Product pages must have WhatsApp and Call buttons instead of a standard checkout.
- **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive admin panel is required to manage all website content, including UI elements, products, and site settings.
- **Feature Enhancements (added during sessions):**
    - Make contact info, social media links, and various page content configurable via the admin panel.
    - Implement local file uploads for images in the admin panel.
    - Allow setting custom prices for each product size variant.
    - Add Bulk Order, Career, and About Us pages.
    - Create a Submissions section in the admin panel to track and export form data.
    - Add SKU to the product detail page.
    - The user has repeatedly requested, debugged, and then discarded various Docker deployment solutions. The current goal is to deploy to Hostinger using Docker.
    - The data seeding process has been a major focus, with the user requesting to add, remove, and re-add the Seed Initial Data feature. The current state includes both automatic seeding on startup (if the DB is empty) and a manual seed button in the admin panel.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) with a Light Pastel Green theme. The backend features a robust data seeding mechanism that can be triggered automatically on startup or manually via an API endpoint connected to a button in the admin panel. The entire application is containerized with Docker, and configuration files (, Dockerfiles, ) are tailored for deployment on Hostinger. The user has been focused on resolving deployment issues, specifically related to data seeding in the Hostinger environment.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user reported that both automatic and manual data seeding fail after deploying to Hostinger. The agent implemented a comprehensive fix to make the seeding process more resilient.
    - A centralized  function was created in  with retry logic to wait for the MongoDB connection to be ready before proceeding.
    - This function is now used by both the application startup event (for auto-seeding) and the manual  endpoint.
    - The  was updated to give the backend container more time to start, preventing it from failing its health check while waiting for the database.
    - The  document was updated with new troubleshooting steps for seeding issues.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (The new seeding logic was tested successfully in the local environment via API calls and log verification).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** The user must first attempt to deploy the updated code to Hostinger. If it fails, the next agent must guide the user to retrieve the backend container logs () from their Hostinger environment to diagnose the failure.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Seed data functionality fails on Hostinger deployment. (P0)**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** A robust  function with database connection retry logic was implemented in . The  health check  was increased to allow more time for the database to become available.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Instruct the user to deploy the latest code to Hostinger.
        2.  If the issue persists, ask the user to provide the full logs from the backend container on their Hostinger server.
        3.  Guide the user to manually trigger the seed endpoint via  from their Hostinger machine () and observe the output.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Data seeding is critical for the initial setup of the website on a new deployment. Fixing it will ensure the site is populated with default content automatically.
    -   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
-   **Issue 2: HTTPS on port 9443 is not working on Hostinger. (P1)**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The  file includes a  service to generate SSL certificates. The  file contains instructions for the user to run the necessary commands.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** This is blocked on the user. The agent must guide the user to follow the SSL generation steps outlined in .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To enable secure HTTPS access for the deployed application.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED (on user action)
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Refactoring (P2):** Clean up the backend codebase by removing obsolete code from . This includes the  field in Pydantic models and the  endpoint, which were related to a previously removed theme customizer feature.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Seeding Mechanism Overhaul:**
    -   Initially fixed the seed logic to be idempotent, preventing duplicate data on re-runs.
    -   Removed the manual seed feature and implemented an auto-seed on startup, as per user request.
    -   Re-added the manual Seed Initial Data button and API endpoint, as per a subsequent user request.
    -   Finally, created a robust, centralized  function with DB connection retry logic to fix failures on Hostinger. This is used by both the auto-seed and manual-seed features.
-   **Docker Configuration Hardening:**
    -   Added a  endpoint to the backend for reliable Docker health checks.
    -   Updated  with  conditions and longer health check start periods to ensure services start in the correct order (MongoDB > backend).
    -   Updated the  to use  and npm <command>

    -   Modified the  to allow Nginx to start even if SSL certificates are not yet present.
-   **Documentation:** Updated  with revised deployment instructions and troubleshooting steps.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Obsolete Backend Code.**
    -   **Debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify that the  endpoint and the  field in Pydantic models are not used by any frontend component.
        2.  If confirmed unused, remove the  route and its associated function from .
        3.  Remove the  field from  in .
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** To reduce technical debt, improve code clarity, and prevent potential bugs from leftover, unused code.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Backend
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   Deployment and data seeding issues are a persistent theme. The user frequently requests changes to the deployment and data setup process.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose are used for packaging and orchestration.
-   **Idempotent Seeding:** The data seeding logic (both auto and manual) is designed to be safely run multiple times, clearing old data before inserting new data to prevent duplicates.
-   **Resilient Startup:** The backend application now retries its database connection on startup, making it more resilient to timing issues in a containerized environment.
-   **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx is used as a reverse proxy, configured to gracefully handle the absence of SSL certificates.

**key DB schema**
-   **site_settings:** Singleton document for global configurations.
-   **products, categories, testimonials, hero_slides, gift_boxes:** Collections for site content.
-   **newsletter_subscriptions, contact_submissions:** Collections for user-submitted data.

**changes in tech stack**
-   The frontend build process within its Docker container was switched from yarn install v1.22.22

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-    contains potentially obsolete code ( field and the  endpoint) from a removed feature that should be investigated and deleted.

**key api endpoints**
-    (POST): Manually triggers the idempotent data seeding process.
-    (GET): A simple endpoint used by Docker to verify the backend service is running.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Deployment on Hostinger is the sole focus.** The immediate task is to help the user get the application running on their server.
-   **The seeding issue is the main blocker.** The latest implemented code includes a robust fix with retry logic, but it has only been tested locally. Your first step should be to guide the user to deploy and then get logs from their environment if it fails.
-   **The user frequently changes requirements around seeding and deployment.** The current implementation supports both auto-seeding and manual seeding. Do not change this logic without explicit confirmation from the user.
-   **HTTPS setup is blocked on the user.** Guide them using the instructions in  to generate SSL certificates. Do not attempt to solve this from your side.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    was significantly updated.
