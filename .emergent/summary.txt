<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website  under the brand name DryFruto.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core App:** A full-stack web application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- **Branding:** Use the business name DryFruto and slogan Live With Health.
- **Functionality:** Product pages must have WhatsApp and Call buttons instead of a standard checkout.
- **Admin Panel:** A comprehensive admin panel is required to manage all website content, including UI elements, products, and site settings.
- **Feature Enhancements (added during sessions):**
    - Make contact info, social media links, and various page content configurable via the admin panel.
    - Implement local file uploads for images in the admin panel.
    - Allow setting custom prices for each product size variant.
    - Add Bulk Order, Career, and About Us pages.
    - Create a Submissions section in the admin panel to track and export form data.
    - Add SKU to the product detail page.
    - The user has repeatedly requested, debugged, and then discarded various Docker deployment solutions. The latest request is to deploy to Hostinger using Docker.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A functional full-stack application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. Key features include a completely redesigned About Us page, a white-themed product detail page, and a site-wide Light Pastel Green theme. The admin panel has been significantly enhanced with image upload capabilities, a Download Catalogue feature, and fixes for color consistency.

The project contains a complete set of Docker files (,  for each service, and a custom Nginx image) intended for deployment on Hostinger's Docker Manager. The user has been repeatedly changing requirements around deployment, leading to multiple creations and deletions of these files.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Debugging a deployment failure on Hostinger. The user reported an error in seeding initial data and issues accessing the site via HTTPS on port 9443. The agent was attempting to diagnose the seeding error. The HTTPS issue is known to be caused by a lack of SSL certificates, which require user action.
-   **Status:** BLOCKED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** backend testing agent
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0): Error when seeding initial data on Hostinger deployment.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent confirmed the  endpoint exists in  and that the  file is present in the backend directory. The agent also incorrectly tried to solve it by modifying HTTP/HTTPS port settings. The root cause of the error is still unknown.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Instruct the user to provide the logs from the running backend container () on Hostinger to see the Python traceback.
        2.  View the contents of  to check for syntax errors, data format issues, or hardcoded values that might cause a runtime error in the deployment environment.
        3.  Run a  command to manually trigger the endpoint and analyze the response.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The seed data function is critical for populating the website with default content upon initial setup. Fixing it will make deployment seamless.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y (Deployment issues are recurrent, this specific error is new).
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
-   **Issue 2 (P1): HTTPS on port 9443 is not working.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent correctly identified that this is due to missing SSL certificates. The  file includes a  service for this purpose. The agent updated  with instructions for the user to run the necessary commands to generate the certificates.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** This is blocked on the user. The agent must guide the user to follow the SSL generation steps outlined in .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To enable secure HTTPS access for the deployed application.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED (on user action)
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Refactoring (P2):** Clean up the backend codebase by removing obsolete code from . This includes Pydantic model fields (e.g., , ) and the  endpoint related to a previously removed theme customizer feature.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Theme Update:** Implemented a new site-wide Light Pastel Green theme ().
-   **Page Redesigns:**
    -   Redesigned the Product Detail page with a clean, white-based theme.
    -   Redesigned the About Us page with an elegant, modern layout incorporating the site logo.
-   **Admin Panel Enhancements:**
    -   Removed the About Us manager from the admin sidebar and routes.
    -   Added a generic image upload component (drag & drop, URL paste) to the Front End manager for Hero Slides, Categories, etc.
    -   Added a Download Catalogue (CSV/JSON) feature to the Products manager.
    -   Fixed all outstanding color consistency issues in the admin panel.
-   **Bug Fix:** Corrected the newsletter subscription form on the homepage to ensure submissions are saved to the database.
-   **Deployment Files:** Engaged in multiple cycles of creating, debugging, and modifying Docker deployment files (, Dockerfiles, ) for Hostinger, based on user feedback and deployment errors.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Obsolete Backend Code.**
    -   **Debug checklist:**
        1.  Search  for fields like , , .
        2.  Remove these fields from the  and any other relevant Pydantic models.
        3.  Delete the  API endpoint route and its associated function.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** To reduce technical debt, improve code clarity, and prevent potential bugs from leftover, unused code.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Backend
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Containerization:** The application is packaged using Docker and orchestrated with  for deployment.
-   **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to direct traffic to the frontend and backend services and is intended to handle SSL termination.
-   **Deployment Target:** Hostinger Docker Manager.
-   **Styling:** All styling is hardcoded using TailwindCSS classes directly in JSX files.

**key DB schema**
-   **site_settings:** Singleton document holding site-wide configurations. Still contains obsolete fields from the old theme feature.
-   **newsletter_subscriptions:** Stores email and subscription dates for the newsletter.
-   **contact_submissions:** Stores submissions from the Bulk Order form.

**changes in tech stack**
-   Docker has been re-introduced as the primary deployment technology.

**All files of reference**
-   : Defines all services, networks, and volumes for deployment.
-   : Defines the build process for the FastAPI backend service.
-   : Defines the build process for the React frontend service.
-   : Builds a custom Nginx image with the configuration file included.
-   : Contains the  endpoint which is currently failing.
-   : Contains the data for the seeding process. **This file has not been inspected and is a likely source of the error.**
-   : Contains critical, user-facing instructions for deployment and SSL setup.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Backend Cleanup:**  contains obsolete code from a removed feature that should be deleted.
-   The  file is obsolete and should be deleted.

**key api endpoints**
-    (POST): The endpoint for populating initial site data, currently failing on deployment.
-    (POST): Handles image uploads from the admin panel.
-    (POST): Handles newsletter sign-ups.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User changes direction frequently:** The user has a pattern of requesting complex features (especially for deployment) and then asking for them to be removed or completely changed. **Confirm all plans before execution.**
-   **Deployment is the main blocker:** The current focus is entirely on getting the application to run on the user's Hostinger server. The  error is the immediate obstacle.
-   ** is a blind spot:** The previous agent never inspected the contents of this file, which is a prime suspect for the current deployment error. This should be one of your first actions.
-   **HTTPS setup requires user action:** The Docker setup is prepared for HTTPS, but the user must execute the  commands on their server to generate the SSL certificates. The agent's role is to guide them based on .
